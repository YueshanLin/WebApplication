  * -5, Your calculator crashes when the hidden field is modified or removed. The application should not crash as a result of any client provided information. You shouldn’t assume that clients will always send input in the format that you specify. HTTP requests can be very easily forged.
  * -5, Your calculator crashes on a non-numeric string entered as a button value. The application should not crash as a result of any client provided information. You shouldn’t assume that clients will always send input in the format that you specify. HTTP requests can be very easily forged.  

### Routing and configuration (8/10)
  * -2, The empty URL (http://localhost:8000/) should be routed to your calculator.  Although it's common to have application-specific routes defined in the application's urls.py file, it's fine to add a default empty route for the project to the project's urls.py file.  You can define a regular expression to match the empty URL with `url(r'^$', ...)`.
