### Grumblr design process (10/10)

### Demonstrates basic familiarity with HTML and CSS

#### Completeness: Solution meets basic specification (10/15)

-1, Should not be able to login/register if already signed in.

-1, Grumblr posts should indicate who posted them by username/id/email.

-3, Itâ€™s unclear from the UI how a user would make a new post.

#### Demonstrates understanding of HTML/CSS (12/15)

-3, CSS should be moved to a separate file rather than declared in a `<style>` block.

-0, We recommend avoiding `&nbsp;` to lay out elements, as they can be unreliable and are not modular. You can accomplish this using css margins and padding instead.

-0.1, There are validation errors in your grumblr HTML.  High-quality HTML should always be validated using [https://validator.w3.org/] to ensure that it meets the HTML standards.

### Appropriate use of course infrastructure and Git (10/10)

### Additional feedback

-0, Please organize your homework projects; all css files should be placed in css/, all images should be in another directory, and html file should not be in css/, etc.
