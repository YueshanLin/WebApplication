Feedback of Grumblr Web Design by Yueshan Lin

1. In the Profile page, rearrange the layout. 
    Put the profile picture, the first name and the last name to the left side of the page;
    Put the historical comments to the middle column of the page;
    In this way, you can make the layout look more balanced and clear.

2. In the Forum page, put trivial information to the last line of each comment. 
    Putting the profile picture, username and the time of comment posted online altogether
makes the page look odd and ugly. Maybe you can put the time to the last line of each comment.

3. Add a background picture. 
    The overall appearance of the webpage looks tedious. A background picture may polish it.
    A background picture may include the slogan of your blog, or some succinct introduction of your blog.
